# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* To run RSpec, you can use the following command:
- `bundle exec rspec [path/to/spec_file.rb]`
- For example, to run the sessions_controller_spec.rb file in the spec/controllers/admin directory:
  `bundle exec rspec spec/controllers/admin/sessions_controller_spec.rb`
